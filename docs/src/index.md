# ![](NeXL_sm.png)Core - Part of the NeXL X-ray Microanalysis Library

## Installing NeXLCore.jl

NeXLCore is available throught the standard Julia registry and can be
installed using the standard package manager.

```julia
julia> ]add NeXLCore
```

or

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("NeXLCore")
```

## Using NeXLCore
NeXLCore provides the core data and algorithms used throughout the NeXL
libraries for elemental and X-ray-related data and calculations.

#### Standards

For consistency, function arguments and outputs will be use the following
standard (unless otherwise mentioned.)

  * All lengths are in centimeters
  * All masses are in grams
  * All energies are in eV
  * All angles are in radians
  * Mixed units are in combinations of these units (MACs are in cmÂ²/g etc.)

The special macro n"..." has been defined to make constructing objects representing
elements, subshells, atomic shells, transitions and characteristic x-rays quick and
easy.

Examples:

    n"Fe" == element(26)
    n"L3" == subshell("L3")
    n"Fe L3" == atomicsubshell(n"Fe",shell("L3"))
    n"L3-M5" == transition(shell("L3"),shell("M5"))
    n"Fe L3-M5" == CharXRay(26, transition(shell("L3"),shell("M5")))
